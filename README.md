# Behavioral Cloning Project

Overview
---
This project utilises a neural network to learn the behaviour of a human driving a vehicle around a track. Using the Udacity simulator the trained model output can autonomously drive around the track.

This repository contains my output model which can navigate autonomously in the simulator, along with the other required files for submission.

### Check list:  

* [model.py](./model.py) - (script used to create and train the model)
* [drive.py](./drive.py) - (script to drive the car)
* [model.h5](./model.h5) - (a trained Keras model)
* [video.mp4](./video.mp4) - (a video recording of vehicle driving autonomously around the track)
* [writeup report](./my_writeup_template.md) - (markdown report of results)

---

### Dataset

As the dataset it quite large it was not uploaded to this repository

### Other files:

* [Jupyter Notebook](./BehaviourInvestigations.ipynb) - (working file to generate outputs and trial ideas )
